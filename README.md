# Sorting Algorithms

This project contains several C programs to demonstrate various sorting algorithms. 
Students are required to complete the code where marked as `TODO` and then compile and run the programs.

## **Getting Started**

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdAmmar/sorintg_algo_tccm.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to the Codes Directory**
Once cloned, navigate to the directory containing the code:
```bash
cd sorintg_algo_tccm
cd exo
```

## **Completing the Tasks**

### **Files to Complete:**
There are 5 programs in this project:

1. `sort_bubble` - Implements Bubble Sort.
2. `sort_merge` - Implements Merge Sort.
3. `sort_quick` - Implements Quick Sort.
4. `sort_radix` - Implements Radix Sort.
5. `overlap` - Calculates the overlap between two CI wavefunctions.

Each of these files has `TODO` comments indicating the sections you need to complete. 
Carefully read the code, complete the missing parts, and ensure your implementation is correct.

## **Compiling the Code:**
Use the provided `Makefile` to compile each program individually. For example, to compile the `sort_bubble` program, run:
```bash
make sort_bubble
```

---

## **Running the Programs**

Once compiled, run the executables generated in the directory. For example:
```bash
./sort_bubble
```
